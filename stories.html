Dad, Jack and I got out of the truck and started up into the hills. We didnt have to walk far before we saw the first fallow trot over a ridge ahead of us. as we crept over the ridge we saw its buddy walking 30 or so metres ahead of it now making their way across the valley face on the other side. knowing that my rifle was zeroed in for 100m and the fallow was probably around 60m away but on the downhill at around a 45 degree angle. This meant I needed to place the cross hairs lower than the animal to account of the trajectory path of the projectile not droping to its zeroed point. all in all a good days hunting and a total of 5 deer shot that week end 3 by me and 2 by jack.'
